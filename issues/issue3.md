# Analysis of Criterion 3 (Clearing the Neighborhood)

**Does Pluto satisfy the criterion of having 'cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit'? This is the most contentious point. Discuss the concept of 'clearing the neighborhood' and analyze Pluto's situation in the Kuiper Belt. Provide evidence for and against this point.**

## Discussion

The "clearing the neighborhood" criterion requires that a planet be gravitationally dominant in its orbital zone, with no other bodies of comparable size except its own satellites. Pluto resides in the Kuiper Belt, a region teeming with icy bodies, many of which are similar in size (e.g., Eris, Makemake, Haumea). Pluto's gravitational influence is not dominant; it shares its orbital space with countless other objects.

## Evidence Against Clearing

- The Kuiper Belt contains numerous trans‑Neptunian objects (TNOs) that cross or share Pluto's orbital zone.
- Pluto's mass is only about 0.2% of the total mass in its orbital region.
- The presence of other large dwarf planets (Eris, etc.) demonstrates that Pluto is not the dominant body.

## Evidence For Clearing (limited)
- Some argue that Pluto's orbital resonances with Neptune (3:2 mean‑motion resonance) could be considered a form of dynamical clearing, but this is not the same as gravitational dominance.
- The IAU definition does not explicitly account for resonant protection.

## Conclusion
Pluto fails the third IAU criterion.
