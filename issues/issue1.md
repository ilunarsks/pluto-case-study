# Analysis of Criterion 1 (Orbit)

**Does Pluto satisfy the criterion of being 'in orbit around the Sun'? Discuss this point and provide any relevant supporting facts.**

## Discussion

Pluto orbits the Sun with a period of approximately 248 Earth years. Its orbit is elliptical and inclined about 17 degrees relative to the ecliptic plane. This satisfies the first IAU criterion.

## Supporting Facts

- Pluto's orbit is heliocentric, not gravitationally bound to another planet.
- Orbital characteristics: semi-major axis ~39.5 AU, eccentricity ~0.25.
- No debate exists about this criterion; all astronomers agree Pluto orbits the Sun.
