# Analysis of Criterion 2 (Hydrostatic Equilibrium)

**Does Pluto satisfy the criterion of having 'sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape'? Discuss this point and provide any relevant supporting facts.**

## Discussion

Pluto's shape is nearly spherical, as confirmed by the New Horizons mission in 2015. Its diameter (~2,377 km) and mass (~1.303×10^22 kg) are sufficient for self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces, resulting in hydrostatic equilibrium.

## Supporting Facts

- New Horizons imagery shows a round body with only minor topographic variations.
- Pluto's shape is consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium for an icy body of its size.
- Scientific consensus holds that Pluto meets this criterion.
