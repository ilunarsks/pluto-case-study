# Pluto Case Study: The 2006 Reclassification

## Historical Context

Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory. For over seven decades, it was considered the ninth planet of our Solar System. Its initial classification was based on its apparent orbit around the Sun and its distinct nature compared to other known celestial bodies at the time. However, as astronomical technology advanced and more objects were discovered in the outer Solar System—particularly in the Kuiper Belt—questions about Pluto's planetary status began to arise.

## The IAU Planetary Definition (2006)

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially defined the term "planet" for our Solar System. According to Resolution B5, a celestial body must satisfy **three criteria** to be considered a planet:

1. **Orbit around the Sun** – The object must be in orbit around the Sun (and not be a satellite of another planet).
2. **Hydrostatic equilibrium** – The object must have sufficient mass for its self‑gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a nearly round shape (hydrostatic equilibrium).
3. **Cleared the neighborhood** – The object must have “cleared the neighbourhood” around its orbit, meaning it has become gravitationally dominant in its orbital zone, with no other bodies of comparable size except its own satellites or those under its gravitational influence.

## Central Question

**Based on the IAU criteria, was the demotion of Pluto to a dwarf planet a scientifically justified decision?**

This case study uses GitHub’s collaborative features to analyze each of the three criteria, gather relevant scientific arguments, and synthesize a reasoned conclusion. The discussion is structured into three dedicated issues (one per criterion), and the final analysis is presented in a separate conclusion document.

## Project Structure

- **Issues** – Three open discussions, each focused on one IAU criterion.
- **Conclusion** – A final summary (`conclusion.md`) that integrates the evidence and answers the central question.
- **Pull Request** – A pull request merging the conclusion into the main branch, simulating a peer‑reviewed synthesis.

## How to Contribute

Feel free to comment on the issues with supporting facts, references, or counter‑arguments. The goal is to build a comprehensive, evidence‑based understanding of Pluto’s reclassification.
